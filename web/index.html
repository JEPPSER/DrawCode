                    <h3>Specify the type of diagram</h3>
                    <p>The type of diagram you want to make has to be specified at the very first line.
                    To specify that you want to make a flowchart, write &#60flowchart&#62 in the first line.
                    Load the "Flowchart" example from the menu bar for reference.</p>
                    <h3>Add an object to the diagram</h3>
                    <p>There are a number of different objects that can be added to a flowchart:<br>
                    Step, If, IOBox, Document, Start and End.<br>
                    You can explore what the different objects look like by loading the "Flowchart" example.<br>
                    An object is initialized by typing the name of the object followed by a space and a variable name.<br>
                    (Variable names can be of any length.)<br>
                    <br>
                    Example:<br>
                    Step a<br>
                    Document b<br>
                    <br>
                    An object will only appear if it is connected to another object by an arrow.<br>
                    (note: Each command must be separated by a new line)</p>
                    <h3>Draw arrows between objects</h3>
                    <p>To draw an arrow between two objects, two objects must have been initialized.<br>
                    The operator for the arrow is [variable]->[variable]<br>
                    <br>
                    Example:<br>
                    Step a<br>
                    IOBox b<br>
                    a->b<br>
                    <br>
                    "If" objects can only have one arrow for "yes" and one arrow for "no".<br>
                    The arrow operator for If is therefore different from all the other objects.<br>
                    The operator for If is [variable].yes=[variable] and [variable].no=[variable]</p>
                    <h3>Set the text displayed in an object</h3>
                    <p>Every object in a flowchart can display some text. The operator is [variable].text="some text"<br>
                    <br>
                    Example:<br>
                    Step a<br>
                    a.text="Plug in lamp"<br>
                    If b<br>
                    b.text="Does lamp work?"</p>
                    <h3>Object placement</h3>
                    <p>When clicking the "Draw" button, an algorithm will place the different objects in the flowchart
                    as well as it can. In most cases smaller flowcharts will look good and well distributed but sometimes
                    you might want to change the placements on your own. This is simply done by dragging and dropping
                    objects with the cursor. You can also change the appearance of the arrows by clicking them and creating
                    new points. The arrow will then be drawn from point to point and create a path. These points can also be
                    moved by dragging and dropping. To delete a point, simply right click on it.<br>
                    <br>
                    To test changing object placement, simply load the "Flowchart" example from
                    the menu bar and try changing the appearance of the flowchart in as many ways as you can.</p>

                <div id="Usecase" class="tabcontent">
                    <h3>Specify the type of diagram</h3>
                    <p>The type of diagram you want to make has to be specified at the very first line.
                    To specify that you want to make a use case diagram, write &#60usecase&#62 in the first line.
                    Load the "Use Case Diagram" example from the menu bar for reference.</p>
                    <h3>Add an object to the diagram</h3>
                    <p>There are three different objects that can be added to a use case diagram:
                    Actor, UseCase and System.<br>
                    You can explore what the different objects look like by loading the "Use Case Diagram" example.<br>
                    An object is initialized by typing the name of the object followed by a space and a variable name.<br>
                    (Variable names can be of any length.)<br>
                    <br>
                    Example:<br>
                    Actor a<br>
                    UseCase b<br>
                    System sys<br>
                    <br>
                    (note: Each command must be separated by a new line)</p>
                    <h3>Set the text displayed in an object</h3>
                    <p>Every object in a use case diagram can display some text. The operator is [variable].text="some text"<br>
                    <br>
                    Example:<br>
                    Actor a<br>
                    a.text="User"<br>
                    UseCase b<br>
                    b.text="Check in"</p>
                    <h3>Add UseCases to System</h3>
                    <p>A system is displayed as a square. The size and position of this square depends only on the placement
                    of the use cases that it contains. The system will encapsulate all the use cases that it contains.<br>
                    The operator for adding a UseCase to a System is [variable] add [variable] where the first variable is
                    of type System and the second variable is of type UseCase.<br>
                    <br>
                    Example:<br>
                    System sys<br>
                    UseCase u<br>
                    sys add u</p>
                    <h3>Draw line between Actor and UseCase</h3>
                    <p>The operator for drawing a line between an Actor and a UseCase is [variable]->[variable] where
                    the first variable is of type Actor and the second variable is of type UseCase.<br>
                    <br>
                    Example:<br>
                    Actor a<br>
                    UseCase b<br>
                    a->b</p>
                    <h3>Draw extend and include arrows between UseCases</h3>
                    <p>The operators for drawing include/extend arrows between two usecases are [variable] includes [variable]<br>
                    and [variable] extends [variable] where both variables are of type UseCase.<br>
                    <br>
                    Example:<br>
                    UseCase a<br>
                    UseCase b<br>
                    UseCase c<br>
                    a includes b<br>
                    b extends c</p>
                    <h3>Draw generalization arrow between Actors</h3>
                    <p>The operator for drawing a generalization arrow between two Actors is [variable] implements [variable]
                    where both variables are of type Actor.<br>
                    <br>
                    Example:<br>
                    Actor a<br>
                    Actor b<br>
                    a implements b</p>
                    <h3>Object placement</h3>
                    <p>When clicking the "Draw" button, an algorithm will place the different objects in the diagram
                    as well as it can. In most cases smaller diagrams will look good and well distributed but sometimes
                    you might want to change the placements on your own. This is simply done by dragging and dropping
                    objects with the cursor.<br>
                    <br>
                    To test changing object placement, simply load the "Use Case Diagram" example from
                    the menu bar and try changing the appearance of the diagram in as many ways as you can.</p>

                <div id="DFA" class="tabcontent">
                    <h3>Specify the type of diagram</h3>
                    <p>The type of diagram you want to make has to be specified at the very first line.
                    To specify that you want to make a DFA, write &#60dfa&#62 in the first line.
                    Load the "DFA" example from the menu bar for reference.</p>
                    <h3>Add an object to the diagram</h3>
                    <p>There are three different objects that can be added to a DFA:
                    start state, normal state and end state. Syntax for start state is ->State, normal state is State, end state is (State).
                    You can explore what the different objects look like by loading the "DFA" example.<br>
                    An object is initialized by typing the name of the object followed by a space and a variable name.<br>
                    (Variable names can be of any length.)<br>
                    <br>
                    Example:<br>
                    ->State s1<br>
                    State s2<br>
                    (State) s3<br>
                    <br>
                    (note: Each command must be separated by a new line)</p>
                    <h3>Draw an arrow between two states (or to itself)</h3>
                    <p>The operator for drawing an arrow is [variable]->[variable]: [text].<br>
                    [text] is any text you want to display next to the arrow.<br>
                    <br>
                    Example:<br>
                    ->State s1<br>
                    State s2<br>
                    (State) s3<br>
                    s1->s2: a<br>
                    s1->s3: b<br>
                    s2->s2: a,c<br>
                    s2->s3: b</p>
                    <h3>Object placement</h3>
                    <p>When clicking the "Draw" button, an algorithm will place the different objects in the diagram
                    as well as it can. The algorithm will place all objects that are connected next to eachother and the
                    distance between all objects will be big enough so no objects will overlap but
                    you might want to change the placements on your own. This is simply done by dragging and dropping
                    objects with the cursor.<br>
                    <br>
                    You can bend arrows by clicking them to create new points that a curve will be drawn though.
                    Move the points by clicking and dragging the red circle visible when hovering over the arrow.
                    Arrows that go from and to the same object and looping arrows do not have this functionality.
                    To remove the point and make the arrow staight again, simply right click on the red circle.<br>
                    <br>
                    To test changing object placement, simply load the "DFA" example from the menu bar and try
                    changing the appearance of the diagram in as many ways as you can.</p>

                    <h3>Specify the type of diagram</h3>
                    <p>The type of diagram you want to make has to be specified at the very first line.
                    To specify that you want to make a class diagram, write &#60class&#62 in the first line.
                    Load the "Class Diagram" example from the menu bar for reference.</p>
                    <h3>Add a class to the diagram</h3>
                    <p>There are 3 different types of classes you can include in your class diagram: 
                    Class, Enum and Interface. To add a class to the diagram, type the name of the type of class
                    followed by a space and a variable name. The variable name will be considered to be the class
                    name and will be displayed at the top of the class.<br>
                    <br>
                    Example:<br>
                    Class Car<br>
                    Enum FuelType<br>
                    Interface Vehicle<br>
                    <br>
                    (note: Each command must be separated by a new line)</p>
                    <h3>Add a package to the diagram</h3>
                    <p>Adding a package works similarly to adding a class. You type "Package" followed by a space
                    and a variable name. The name of the package is the name of the variable unless you manually set
                    the text. This is done by typing the variable name followed by .text="your package name".
                    To add classes to the package, type the package name followed by " add " and the variable name
                    of the class you want to add.<br>
                    <br>
                    Example:<br>
                    Package package<br>
                    package.text="vehicle"<br>
                    package add Car<br>
                    package add FuelType</p>
                    <h3>Add dependency</h3>
                    <p>Vehicle-->Car</p>
                    <h3>Add realization</h3>
                    <p>Vehicle--|>Car</p>
                    <h3>Add inheritance (generalization)</h3>
                    <p>Vehicle-|>Car</p>
                    <h3>Add association</h3>
                    <p>Vehicle(0..*)-(1)Car</p>
                    <h3>Add direct association</h3>
                    <p>Vehicle(1)->(1)Car</p>
                    <h3>Add aggregation</h3>
                    <p>Vehicle(1..*)&#60&#62-(1)Car</p>
                    <h3>Add Composition</h3>
                    <p>Vehicle(1)&#60#&#62-(1..*)Car</p>
                    <h3>Object placement</h3>
                    <p>When clicking the "Draw" button, an algorithm will place the classes in the diagram
                    as well as it can. You will probably want to change the placements on your own. This is simply done by dragging and dropping
                    classes with the cursor. You can also change the appearance of the arrows by clicking them and creating
                    new points. The arrow will then be drawn from point to point and create a path. These points can also be
                    moved by dragging and dropping. To delete a point, simply right click on it.<br>
